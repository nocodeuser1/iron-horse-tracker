## 💡 Key Talking Points

**For Iron Horse:**
1. **"We handle the data entry"** - Upload permit PDF, we extract requirements
2. **"Never miss a deadline"** - Visual calendar + smart notifications
3. **"Built for environmental compliance"** - Not a generic task manager
4. **"Your brand, your platform"** - Custom logo and branding
5. **"Enterprise-grade security"** - Role-based access, audit trails
6. **"Scales with you"** - Add facilities, permit types, users as needed
7. **"Affordable & transparent"** - $79/month, no hidden fees

**Privacy/AI Messaging:**
- Default: **Manual extraction** (our team processes your permits)
- Optional: **AI-assisted** (faster, but you control when/if we use it)
- Your permit data stays private, secure, and under your control
